#  Financial Performance & Profitability Analytics (Cryptocurrency)

### Project Overview
This project analyzes the historical performance and risk characteristics of major cryptocurrency assets—Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Binance Coin—using Python, SQL, Power BI, and Excel.
The focus is on return analysis, volatility measurement, drawdown risk, and asset-to-asset comparison to support data-driven financial insights.

### Objectives
1. Evaluate historical price performance of multiple cryptocurrency assets
2. Calculate daily returns, cumulative returns, volatility, and drawdowns
3. Compare assets based on risk–return characteristics
4. Validate analytical results across Python, SQL, and Power BI
5. Build an interactive, finance-style dashboard for decision-making

### Tools & Technologies
1. Python (Pandas, NumPy) – Data cleaning, transformation, financial metric computation
2. SQL (MySQL) – Analytical queries for validation and comparison
3. Power BI – Interactive dashboards and financial storytelling
4. Excel – Data validation and cross-verification

### Dataset Used
Historical cryptocurrency price data including:
1. Open, High, Low, Close prices
2. Trading Volume and Market Capitalization
3. Assets analyzed: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB)

### Key Validated Insights
1. Return Performance
All three cryptocurrencies exhibit positive long-term cumulative returns
Bitcoin shows steadier growth, while Ethereum and Binance Coin demonstrate higher variability
Long-term profitability is visible despite short-term fluctuations

2. Volatility Analysis
Bitcoin has the lowest volatility, indicating relative price stability
Ethereum shows moderate volatility
Binance Coin exhibits the highest volatility, reflecting higher risk

3. Drawdown (Downside Risk)
Binance Coin experiences the deepest drawdowns, indicating higher downside exposure
Bitcoin shows smaller and more controlled drawdowns
Drawdown analysis highlights that higher returns often come with higher risk

4. Risk–Return Tradeoff
Bitcoin delivers the most efficient risk-adjusted returns
Higher volatility assets do not consistently provide superior returns
Risk-adjusted metrics reveal that stability can outperform aggressive growth strategies

### Data Validation Across Tools
1. Financial metrics (daily return, cumulative return, volatility, drawdown) were first calculated in Python
2. The same metrics were recomputed using SQL analytical functions (window functions, aggregations)
3. Power BI visuals were built using DAX measures based on the validated dataset
4. Insights derived from Python, SQL, and Power BI consistently matched, confirming correctness of calculations
This cross-tool validation strengthens confidence in the results and demonstrates an end-to-end analytics workflow.

### Power BI Dashboard (Live)
An interactive Power BI dashboard has been published to visualize cryptocurrency performance, risk, and return dynamics.

### What I Learned
1. Strengthened understanding of return metrics, including daily returns, cumulative returns, and risk-adjusted performance
2. Learned how to analyze volatility and drawdowns to assess downside risk, not just profitability
3. Practiced data validation across Python, SQL, Excel, and Power BI, ensuring consistent results across tools
4. Developed proficiency in Power BI DAX measures, interactive slicers, and tooltip-driven storytelling
5. Improved ability to translate raw financial data into clear, decision-focused dashboards
